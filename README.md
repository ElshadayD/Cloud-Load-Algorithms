# Cloud-Load-Balancing-Algorithms


This project focuses on analyzing and evaluating different cloud load-balancing algorithms to assess their performance and associated costs. The analysis includes measuring response times, processing times, and cost aspects of the system or service. The goal is to provide insights into the efficiency and financial implications of running and maintaining the system.

## Introduction

The Cloud Load Balancing Analysis project aims to assess the effectiveness of various load-balancing algorithms in distributing workloads across cloud systems. The project utilizes simulations to measure response times, processing times, and associated expenses.

## Features

- Simulated different load-balancing algorithms
- Measured response times and processing times
- Evaluated associated costs (virtual machine costs, data transfer costs)
- Comparative analysis of different algorithms
- Visual representation of performance metrics


## Results

The results of the simulation provide valuable insights into the performance and cost aspects of different load-balancing algorithms. The analysis includes:

- Response times: Average, minimum, and maximum durations for the system to respond to requests.
- Processing times: Average, minimum, and maximum durations spent on processing tasks within the system.
- Cost breakdown: Details on virtual machine costs and data transfer costs.

The generated reports and visualizations help to understand the efficiency and financial implications of running and maintaining the system under different load-balancing algorithms.
